# Study of patient information with cardiovascular diseases

Heart failure (HF) has been a major clinical and public health problem since its designation as a new epidemic in 1997 (Braunwald, 1997). Despite enormous efforts by public health organizations to treat and control HF, studies show that the burden of death and hospitalization remains mostly unchanged (Levy et al., 2002; Roger et al., 2004). In the CDC's 1999-2020 summary of underlying causes of death in the United States, heart failure still ranks first (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022).

At the same time, the digitalization of medical and clinical information has made a major contribution to the study of diseases (Kraus et al., 2021). Here, we use data collected and extracted from a large de-identified publicly available dataset called MIMIC III to build a visualization tool for easier investigation of the information of patients with cardiovascular diseases. We majorly focus on lab tests and patient demographics.

MIMIC III (Johnson et al., 2016) contains de-identified health-related data for over 38,597 patients who stayed in the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center's intensive care unit between 2001 and 2012. Demographics, vital sign measurements taken at the bedside, laboratory test results, procedures, prescriptions, carer notes, imaging reports, and mortality are all included in the database.
